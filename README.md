# netflix-eda
As a data analyst ,  I have performed an exploratory data analysis over the Netflix dataset obtained from Kaggle,  which helps identify errors in data sets, gives a better understanding of the data set,   helps detect outliers
, helps understand data set variables and the relationship among them. 
I performed EDA on Netflix dataset in jupyter notebook using python and its libraries. The libraries I used were : Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn.
I have done the following analysis : remove the duplicate records, finding null values and showing those using heat-map, perform various tasks to do a thorough analysis.
